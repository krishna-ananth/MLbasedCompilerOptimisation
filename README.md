# MLbasedCompilerOptimisation
Selecting a good set of compiler optimization flags is a challenging task due to the fast change and rapid improvement in microprocessor technology along with static and dynamic profile of programs. Recent work has shown that machine learning can automate and in some cases outperform hand crafted compiler optimizations. Central to such an approach is that machine learning techniques typically rely upon summaries or features of the program. The quality of these features is critical to the accuracy of the resulting machine learned algorithm; no machine learning method will work well with poorly chosen features. However, due to the size and complexity of programs, theoretically there are an infinite number of potential features to choose from. The compiler writer now has to expend effort in choosing the best features from this space. Our aim is to develop a machine learning based algorithm for self-tuning compilers which will generate a combination of compiler flags that will minimize Run-time/ Compile- time/ Code-size etc.
